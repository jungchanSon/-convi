## Overview

Convi Commit Buddy is an IntelliJ plugin designed to help developers generate clear and consistent Git commit messages.  
By analyzing your staged changes, the plugin uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to suggest relevant commit messages directly inside the commit panel.

Whether youâ€™re using a local LLM like Ollama or a hosted provider like OpenAI, Convi lets you configure and switch providers easily.

## Key Features

- Generate commit messages using staged diffs and LLMs
- Integrated with the commit panel UI (no need to leave your IDE)
- Supports both local (Ollama) and remote (ChatGPT/OpenAI) providers
- Configure API keys and models per project
- Minimal UI footprint and intuitive configuration

Settings are saved per project to support flexible multi-project workflows.
